# How to use NanopolishComp

NanopolishComp was designed to be used either through a python API or a command line interface.

The package contains 2 modules: `Eventalign_collapse` and `Freq_meth_calculate`

## Eventalign_collapse

Eventalign_collapse collapses the raw file generated by `nanopolish eventalign` by kmers rather than by event.
